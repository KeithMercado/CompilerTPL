# Mini Compiler  

## Description  
The **Mini Compiler** is a Java-based application with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** designed to perform **Lexical Analysis**, **Syntax Analysis**, and **Semantic Analysis**. It accepts `.java` and `.txt` files as input and analyzes their content for errors and correctness.

## Features  
1. **Lexical Analysis**  
   - Tokenizes the input into meaningful elements like keywords, identifiers, and symbols.  
   - Detects invalid tokens or unrecognized characters.  

2. **Syntax Analysis**  
   - Verifies code structure against Java grammar rules.  
   - Identifies issues such as missing braces or incorrect statement formats.  

3. **Semantic Analysis**  
   - Checks for logical errors like undeclared variables or type mismatches.
